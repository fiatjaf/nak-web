### building

Here is one way you can build and host a local copy of `nak-web`:
1. install [Nix](https://nixos.org) the package manager, and make sure [flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) are enabled
2. checkout this repo and `cd` into it
3. `nix develop` will get you into a dev environment with all the things (`sbt`)
4. `sbt fullLinkJS/esBuild` will build the all important `bundle.js` file
5. `python3 -m http.server 8743` will serve up the html/js app at http://localhost:8743
